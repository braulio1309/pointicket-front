Once the Buyer and Seller have agreed on a transaction, all transactions are covered by the Pointickets Guarantee. Pointickets' obligations are solely related to the mediation service.

If the tickets do not correspond to what the seller offered and the buyer cannot attend the event, a refund will be issued.
